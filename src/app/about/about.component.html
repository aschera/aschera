        <h1>Hey! I’m Christina</h1>

        <p>
          I’m an <b>Front end developer</b> who’s been creating experiences for the web for some years.
          <br>
          Before that I was a master of problem-solving tech-support for Canon and Samsung.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now I work at

          <a href="https://www.novacura.com/Novacura " target="_blank">
            Novacura
          </a>
          in a international crossfunctional, agile team with mostly Angular.
        </p>

        <p>

          I'm also currently studying. For a <b>B.A. in Computer Science</b> at the
          <a href=" https://www.uopeople.edu/" target="_blank">
          University of the People.
        </a>
<br>
        Right now I'm taking Calculus.
        <br>
        After which I only need three more courses:<br>
         - 'Information Retrieval',<br>

         - 'Artificial Intelligence',<br>

         - 'Data Mining and Machine Learning'.
         <br><br>

          I'm not looking for new work right now, but do still enjoy the occasional email.
          And if a really good offer comes along... well who knows :)
