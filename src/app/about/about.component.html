      <h3>I'm a data scientist</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Christina and I currently study to become a data scientist. <br />
        I'm based in Gothenburg, Sweden. <br /><br />
        I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science (University of the People).
      </p>
      <h3>My passion</h3>
      <p>
        Ever since I was a child, I have had a passion for problem-solving and improving the world around me.
        <br /><br />
        This mindset carries over to my approach to analyzing large data sets and understanding every aspect of the
        world -
        constantly questioning how it can be improved,
        how it operates, and why.
        <br /><br />
        The thrill of discovering solutions to complex issues and uncovering patterns that
        have gone unnoticed by others is what drives me.

      <h3>I'm also a front end developer</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout my career, I have amassed over four years of experience as a front-end developer. <br /><br />
        I'm
        specialized in doing websolutions for low-code technology, marketing, and e-commerce.
        <br /><br />
        My strong understanding of user experience, accessibility,
        and programming has enabled me to excel in my current role as a data scientist, as I am able to bridge the gap
        between
        users and analysts.
