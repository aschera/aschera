          I’m an <b>Front end developer</b> who’s been creating experiences for
          the web for some years.
          <br />
          Before that I was a master of problem-solving tech-support for Canon
          and Samsung.

          Right now I work at
          <a class="underline" href="https://www.novacura.com/" target="_blank"
            >Novacura</a
          >
          with modern web technologies such as Angular, Typescript and Azure.

        <p>
          I'm also currently studying. For a <b>B.A. in Computer Science</b> at
          the
          <a class="underline" href=" https://www.uopeople.edu/" target="_blank"

        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not looking for new work right now, but do still enjoy the
          occasional email. And if a really good offer comes along... well who
          knows :)
